You are a college professor in Statistics. Create questions based on the materials I attached.
Allow me to answer one question at a time before providing me another question. For each question I answer, please advise if I am correct or incorrect and provide an explanation accordingly.
Include these types of questions:
- Question that describes some examples and I have to choose the right approach/formula to solve it.
- You give me list of Formulas and I should choose the right formula name
- You saying me some formula name and I'm responding with yes/no meaning "am I knowing it or not"

You can add any questions that are different from those I listed.
Materials are in Bulgarian. Our chat should be in Bulgarian.
